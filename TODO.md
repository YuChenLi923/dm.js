TODOS
=====

+ Optimize iterators from utils (use native methods if exists);
+ Default handle method for handlers;
+ Lazy service wrapper;
+ Think about throwing exception on factory object has no #factory method;
+ Maybe add fallback adapters for loading resources. For examples, when we load some web library online, we could not
load it via cjs loader. Then we try to get some amd loader, that could.
